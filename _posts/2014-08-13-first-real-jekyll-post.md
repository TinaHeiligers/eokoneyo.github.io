 its weird that i started learning web development backwards than most people ever did
 started with php seriously, ive always kinda knew HTML but was until after 2 years of 
 wordpress then i picked an interest in php.
 then one e-commerce project which i made use of said php made me realise i need to actually learn HTML
 and so swallowing pride and all i learnt HTML; video tutorials and all. but thats not what this post is about is it?

 just testing jekyll, heard about jekyll two days ago.. and ive made up my mind to create my own jekyll website template :)

```php
echo "Amma do it!";
```
