## Overview
WPND is culled from tooling I built whilst helping a non-profit organization, the Nigerian community here in Berlin. 
I wanted to be able to spin up a WordPress instance to test some work I was doing which involved writing custom themes and plugins for the project, 
without having to set up the requirements to run a wordPress installation directly on my machine.

I wanted something simple, that really just did the bare minimum to provide a development environment, I took an approach that leverages 
the node ecosystem, so that means any FED can prototype WordPress websites as long as they already have docker and the NodeJS runtime installed. 

To create a quick development with the defaults wpnd ships with, here's all you need to get started;

```bash
npx --package=wpnd@latest wpnd start
```

This will produce a disposable container that will be accessible at the url displayed in your terminal, like so;

Need to install the following packages:

There's other configurations that allowing specifying configs, that allows the user test out any custom theme you might be building, 
also with support to install plugins from the WordPress repository as packages added to a dependency list leveraging [wpackagist](https://wpackagist.org/).
