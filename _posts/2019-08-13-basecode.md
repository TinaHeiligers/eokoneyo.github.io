## Overview

Basecode started as a side project amongst myself, and a colleague I was working together with at Konga[^1]. We wanted to
do something to help bridge the digital skill literacy gap in Nigeria, especially since it was a quite a way to escape
the stereotypic career path that's prevalent in Nigeria and definitely paid more. Interestingly enough it got a feature on Techpoint[^2]

### Bringing Basecode to Life

I chose to use WordPress for the project, asides from the fact that I was experimenting a lot with WordPress a lot at the time, it 
definitely allowed me to just focus on building the functionality for the website really fast, whilst allowing my partner to experiment on appropriate content for the website.

Designs for the basecode website were primarily through iterations, something that was very important at the start of 
the project was capturing an essence of Nigeria in the design in some way. Eventually we settled on a silhouette of one of the most prestigious places 
in Lagos, Nigeria; the National theater.
